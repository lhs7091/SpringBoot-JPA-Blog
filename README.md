# Ajax
I use Ajax for sign up function.  
The reason of using ajax, 
  - ajax can define only one server to be able to return data or html  
    - client request by browser. 
    - server response by html.  
    - browser read html and show to client.  
    - server connect to DB and execute sign up function.
    - Data can't return to browser  
  - Asynchronous Communication
